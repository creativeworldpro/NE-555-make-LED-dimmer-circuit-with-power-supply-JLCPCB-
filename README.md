In this project, weâ€™ll teach you making a LED dimmer light circuit. An LED, also known as a light emitting diode, can be made to blink. Not only can the LED be made to blink manually, but it can also be made to blink by itself. Regardless of the method you choose to make your LED blink, you will need other electronic components to make the LED blink. For simple designs, all you will need is a manual switch.  There are several ways of making a blinking LED circuit. You can make one using relays. This primary flasher circuit generally relies on a few components to achieve blinking.
